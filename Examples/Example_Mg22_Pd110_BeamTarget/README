Example: Mg22 beam excited by a Pd110 target

Files (input):
makefile: Should work as long as the example is compiled in this directory. Addresses to Cygnus libraries are relative. 
mg22_pd.inp: GOSIA input file used to generate yields for the beam-like particle.
pd110_mg.inp: GOSIA input file used to generate yields for the target-like particle.
chico97.gdt: File used as input for se76_pb.inp, to indicate GOSIA should not efficiency modify yields.
Data_Mg22.txt: Beam-like yield data generated by GOSIA, formatted for CYGNUS. Yields were multiplied by a common factor to reasonably represent experimental yields. Uncertainties determined as SQRT(Y). 
Data_Pd110.txt: Beam-like yield data generated by GOSIA, formatted for CYGNUS. Yields were multiplied by a common factor to reasonably represent experimental yields. Uncertainties determined as SQRT(Y). 
NucleusFile_Mg22.txt: File defining the nucleus 22Mg.
NucleusFile_Pd110.txt: File defining the nucleus 110Pd.
Fitting.cxx: Source code for the fitting process, see comments in the code for details. 

Files (output):
CoulExDetails_Beam_*.txt (* = 1-6): Details of the point calculations used in the integration process are written here. Useful for debugging. For the beam.
CoulExDetails_Target_*.txt (* = 1-6): Details of the point calculations used in the integration process are written here. Useful for debugging. For the target.
CrossSections_Beam.root: Theta-Energy meshes of the cross sections for the beam.
CrossSections_Target.root: Theta-Energy meshes of the cross sections for the target.

Running the example:
> ./BeamTarget NucleusFile_Mg22.txt NucleusFile_Pd110.txt Ncores
Where Ncores is the number of threads to be used.

The minimization will use a common scaling factor for both experiments. Note that the Data_Mg22.txt and Data_Pd110.txt filenames are coded within the script and aren't given as a user argument.
