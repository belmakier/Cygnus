Example: Se76 beam excited by a Pb208 target, simulate sensitivity

CYGNUS performs an integration based on the nucleus file. Assuming Poisson statistics and based on the "true" integrated yields, new "measured" values and their uncertainties (assumed sqrt(N)) are calculated and written to a yield text file.

Files (input):
makefile: Should work as long as the example is compiled in this directory. Addresses to Cygnus libraries are relative. 
SimulatedData.txt: Yield data generated by CYGNUS, created every time the executable runs.  
NucleusFile_Se76.txt: File defining the nucleus 76Se. Note that the values of the matrix elements are the same as those defined in the GOSIA input file for Example_Se76_Pb208.
SimulateSensitivity.cxx: Source code for the fitting process, see comments in the code for details. 

Files (output):
OutputFitting_Simulated.root: Theta-Energy meshes of the cross sections.

Running the example:
> ./SimulateSensitivity NucleusFile_Se76.txt Ncores
Where Ncores is the number of threads to be used.

The output will change slightly depending on the randomly generated "measured" values.
