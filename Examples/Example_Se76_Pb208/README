Example: Se76 beam excited by a Pb208 target

Files (input):
makefile: Should work as long as the example is compiled in this directory. Addresses to Cygnus libraries are relative. 
se76_pb.inp: GOSIA input file used to generate yields. Matrix elements defined lines 36-45.
chico97.gdt: File used as input for se76_pb.inp, to indicate GOSIA should not efficiency modify yields.
Data.txt: Yield data generated by GOSIA, formatted for CYGNUS. Yields were multiplied by a common factor to reasonably represent experimental yields. Uncertainties determined as SQRT(Y). 
NucleusFile_Se76.txt: File defining the nucleus 76Se. Note that the values of the matrix elements are different from those defined in the GOSIA input file. 
Fitting.cxx: Source code for the fitting process, see comments in the code for details. 

Files (output):
CoulExDetails_*.txt (* = 1-6): Details of the point calculations used in the integration process are written here. Useful for debugging.
CrossSections.root: Theta-Energy meshes of the cross sections.

Running the example:
> ./Fitting NucleusFile_Se76.txt Data.txt Ncores
Where Ncores is the number of threads to be used.

Input matrix element:	Output matrix element:
0.6486			0.6491	 +/-  0.00404958
0.1071			0.107456 +/-  0.00180431
-0.500			-0.48251 +/-  0.0365474
0.2999			0.30011	 +/-  0.00447435
0.6412			0.642046 +/-  0.00910709
1.1054			1.10577	 +/-  0.0073579

Note that the minor disagreement above is due to the starting matrix elements being wrong. To confirm convergence, the calculation should be repeated with the output matrix elements above used as starting points. Also note, however, that the matrix elements all agree within better than one standard deviation, indicating that the results have nearly converged after only a single iteration.
